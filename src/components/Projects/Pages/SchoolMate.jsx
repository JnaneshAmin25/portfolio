                  The School Bus Tracker App is a real-time safety solution
                  designed for parents to stay informed and reassured about
                  their child’s journey to and from school. It helps parents
                  track boarding and drop-off activity through smart ID scans,
                  provides timely notifications, supports multi-child
                  management, and is available in multiple Indian languages to
                  ensure inclusivity across regions.

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                  The School Bus Tracker App ensures child safety by sending
                  real-time updates to parents when their child boards or exits
                  the bus using a smart ID scan system. It supports families
                  with more than one child, allowing parents to switch between
                  profiles seamlessly. With built-in regional language support,
                  the app is accessible and user-friendly for parents across all
                  regions of India. It also allows parents to modify pickup or
                  drop-off plans directly within the app, adding flexibility to
                  daily routines. Overall, the app addresses real concerns
                  around delays, traffic, and safety, offering peace of mind
                  through a simple and intuitive interface.

            <h3>The Journey</h3>
            <p>
              Designing the School Mate app began with understanding the
              everyday anxieties parents face regarding their child's school
              commute. Through user research, I discovered that simple, timely
              confirmations mattered more than full GPS tracking. I crafted a
              solution with ID-based boarding updates, multi-child management,
              and regional language support. The goal was to create a trusted,
              intuitive, and scalable safety tool for every parent in India.

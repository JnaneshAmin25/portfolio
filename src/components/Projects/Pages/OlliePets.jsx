            <p>
              The journey began with user research to understand pet owners'
              challenges in finding high-quality, tailored pet food. I
              identified pain points like confusing meal customization, lack of
              trust in ingredients, and complex subscription processes. Through
              iterative design, I created a user-friendly interface with smooth
              navigation, meal personalization, and clear communication. The
              final design ensures a seamless, engaging, and trustworthy
              experience for pet owners.

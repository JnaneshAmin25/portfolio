                  provides real-time market data, advanced charting tools,
                  portfolio tracking, order placement, and other trading-related

                  Redesigning Kite by Zerodha focused on improving clarity,
                  navigation, and overall user experience. Users can now
                  effortlessly explore the company’s offerings and track their
                  documentation process with ease. The clear distinction between
                  ETFs and stocks, along with categorized sections, enhances
                  investment understanding. Quick access to various sectors and
                  top performers supports informed decision-making. The
                  introduction of the 'PLANS' feature empowers users to invest
                  strategically in key life stages like education and health,
                  making the app more valuable and user-friendly.

            <h3>The Journey</h3>
            <p>
              The redesign of Kite by Zerodha began with in-depth research to
              identify user pain points like complex navigation, unclear
              ETF-stock distinction, and limited stock discovery. Using design
              thinking, I developed low-fidelity wireframes to improve clarity
              and accessibility. Iterative testing and feedback refined the UI,
              enhancing navigation and simplifying the documentation process.
              Key additions included categorized investment sections, better
              stock tracking, and improved user engagement tools. The final
              design delivered a seamless, intuitive, and efficient trading
              experience for all users.

                <p>
                  Google Classroom is a free blended learning platform developed
                  by Google for educational institutions that aims to simplify
                  creating, distributing, and grading assignments. The primary
                  purpose of Google Classroom is to streamline the process of
                  sharing files between teachers and students.

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                  I redesigned Google Classroom with a fresh, modern look,
                  enhancing usability and engagement. I integrated a seamless
                  chat and call feature for direct student-lecturer interaction.
                  Score tests and assignment rankings were introduced to gamify
                  the learning experience. The UI was revamped for a cleaner,
                  more intuitive navigation system. I focused on improving
                  accessibility and real-time collaboration for students. The
                  entire redesign was completed within a week, ensuring
                  efficiency and innovation.

            <p>
              The journey of designing Classroom began with in-depth user
              research to understand student and teacher needs. I applied design
              thinking to identify pain points and ideate effective solutions.
              Moving from low-fidelity to high-fidelity wireframes, I ensured a
              seamless user experience through rapid iterations.The final design
              brought an intuitive, engaging, and efficient learning environment
              to life.
